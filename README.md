# Protecting-Communities-from-Flood-Risks
Problem Statement
- Weather is unpredictable and though, wheather forecasts are often reliable, they rarely provide instructions on what to do in regards to the location you are in, which can be dangerous especially during typhoons, which the Philippines frequently experience.

Objectives
- Our Predictive Flooding Alert System will use real-time weather and historical data to forecast areas at high risk of flooding.

Planned Features
-  This will allow the project to send early-warning alerts to residents and emergency services, giving them critical time to protect lives and property.

Planned Inputs and Outputs
- The user will input their location and the code will print on their current weather conditions, educate them on early-warning signs, and instructions on what to do to prepare for flooding.
